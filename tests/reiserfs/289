#  bsddf|minixdf
#         Set the behaviour  for  the  statfs  system  call.  The  minixdf
#         behaviour is to return in the f_blocks field the total number of
#         blocks of the filesystem, while the bsddf  behaviour  (which  is
#         the default) is to subtract the overhead blocks used by the ext2
#         filesystem and not available for file storage.

# stat -f output looks like this; we get f_blocks from that, which
# varies depending on the df mount options used below:

#   File: "/mnt/test"
#    ID: affc5f2b2f57652 Namelen: 255     Type: ext2/ext3
# Block size: 4096       Fundamental block size: 4096
# Blocks: Total: 5162741    Free: 5118725    Available: 4856465
# Inodes: Total: 1313760    Free: 1313749
